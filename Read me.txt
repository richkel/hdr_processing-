# Installation Instructions

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

## Setting Up a Virtual Environment

1. Open your command line interface (CLI).
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ``` 
   cd path/to/your/project
Create a virtual environment:
 
Copy code

python -m venv .venv

Activate the virtual environment:
On Windows:
Copy code

.\.venv\Scripts\activate

On macOS/Linux:
Copy code

source .venv/bin/activate

Installing Dependencies
With the virtual environment activated, install the project dependencies:
Copy code

pip install -r requirements.txt

HDRProcessingInvocation (hdr_processing.py):

This file defines a class for HDR image processing. It takes multiple images with different exposure times as input and merges them into a single HDR image using OpenCV functions.

RetrieveImagesFromFileInvocation:

This script is designed to retrieve images from a specified file or directory. It can optionally save these images into a ZIP file.

ExposureTimesNode:

This node handles exposure times for HDR images. It can use either simulated exposure times or user-provided values.
For the full code of these files, you would typically find them in your project's repository or development environment. If you need to view or modify the code, you should refer to the files directly in your project.
